# Ultimate F2P Siege

<div style={{display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', marginBottom: '20px', gap: '20px'}}>
    <div style={{maxWidth: "68px"}}>
        ![Khmun](/img/monsters/Khmun.png)  
        Khmun  
        **(Leader)**  
    </div>
    <div style={{maxWidth: "68px"}}>
        ![Elucia 2A](/img/monsters/Elucia2A.png)  
        Elucia  
        <p>&nbsp;</p>  
    </div>
    <div style={{maxWidth: "68px"}}>
        ![Loren](/img/monsters/Loren.png)  
        Loren  
        <p>&nbsp;</p>  
    </div>
</div>

The idea is **Elucia locks down one enemy with her sleep, Loren strips to set up the sleep and continues to drain the attack bar of the 
"Main" target and Khmun is there to tank and provide shield and some dps**.

Your main target focus should be Wind > Dark > Light the idea is Elucia locks down the neutral element dps, you focus the element that 
threatens Elucia then Loren, leave waters or fire alive so Khum can tank them.

This offence can literally attack into any defence as long as your units are tanky enough to survive a cleave defense. Speed is 
important but they way they are built it's fine taking turn 1 or turn 2.

## Speed tuning 

1. Loren 
2. Elucia 
3. Khmun

## Runes

:::tip Rune Quality difficulty estimation : ðŸŸ¢âšªâšª

Can play turn 1 or turn 2, so it's really flexible between runes stats and speed.
