        Khmun

The idea is Elucia locks down one enemy with her sleep, lauren strips to set up the sleep and continues to drain the attack bar of the "Main" target and Khmun is there to tank and provide shield / some dps.

Your main target focus should be Wind > Dark > Light the idea is elucia locks down the neutral element dps, you focus the element that threatens elucia then lauren, leave waters or fire alive so khum can tank them


This offence can literally attack into any defence as long as your units are tanky enough to survive a cleave defense. Speed is important but they way they are built it's fine taking turn 1 or turn 2
