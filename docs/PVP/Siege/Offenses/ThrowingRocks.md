The idea for this team is to be a reliable 4-star offense as well as being a strong 4-star defense.  

On offense **Aegir moves first to strip / steal atb with his s3 allowing Skogul to move second Triana is just there to keep everyone 
healthy / avoid turn 1 snipes**. Ideally you take
this into slower control defenses or fast single unit snipe ones.

At the start of the fight weather you're moving first or second all you do is S3 the highest atb unit with Aegir then S2 with Skogul.
Cleanup and heal with Triana that's about it. Very strong offense and a decent defense.

## Speed tuning

1. Aegir
2. Skogul
3. Triana

## Runes

:::warning Rune Quality difficulty estimation : ðŸŸ ðŸŸ âšª

Not too hard overall, but a good Triana require nice runes.
