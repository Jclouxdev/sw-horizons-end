# Siege Guide
![SiegeSplashArt](/img/pvp/siege/SiegeSplashArt.png)

Siege is a competitive PVP mode in Summoners War where guilds battle against each other. This guide provides strategies, team compositions, and tips to excel in Siege battles.
## Overview

Siege battles are fought between two guilds, each trying to destroy the opponent's towers while defending their own. The guild that destroys the most towers wins the battle.
Siege battles are divided into two phases: the **Preparation Phase** and the **Battle Phase**.

During the Preparation Phase, guild members can set up their defenses and strategize for the upcoming battle. The Battle Phase is when the actual fights take place, and players can attack enemy towers and defend their own.

This leads us to the first section of the guide, which are the **Siege Defenses**.

## Siege Defenses

Siege defenses are the teams you set up to defend your towers during Siege battles. The goal is to create a strong defense that can withstand enemy attacks and protect your tower.

### Defense Composition
A good defense composition typically consists of a mix of damage dealers, support units, and tanks. Here are some tips for creating a strong defense:
- **Balance**: Ensure your defense has a mix of damage dealers, support units, and tanks. This will make it harder for the enemy to take down your defense.
- **Synergy**: Choose monsters that work well together. For example, a tanky monster can protect a damage dealer while they deal damage.
- **Counter Picks**: Consider the enemy's potential team compositions and choose monsters that can counter them. For example, if you expect a lot of damage dealers, consider using a tanky monster with a shield or heal.
- **Speed**: Speed is crucial in Siege battles. Make sure your defense has at least one fast monster that can take the first turn and set up a strong defense.
- **Runes**: Ensure your monsters are well-runed. Focus on speed, HP, and defense for tanks, and attack and crit rate for damage dealers.
- **Testing**: Test your defense against different team compositions to see how it performs. Make adjustments as needed.
- **Adaptability**: Be prepared to change your defense based on the enemy's team compositions. If you notice a certain team composition is consistently beating your defense, consider changing it up.
- **Communication**: Communicate with your guild members to coordinate your defenses. This will help ensure that your defenses are well-rounded and can withstand enemy attacks.
- **Practice**: Practice makes perfect. The more you practice, the better you'll become at creating strong defenses and countering enemy attacks.
- **Flexibility**: Be flexible with your defense. If a certain team composition isn't working, don't be afraid to change it up. The best defense is one that can adapt to the enemy's team compositions.
